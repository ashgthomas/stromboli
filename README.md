# stromboli
Stromboli's was one of my favorite restaurants to visit during my undergraduate tenure at Mississippi State University. Although I loved their food, their website needed extra attention. I decided to do a mock redesign of their current website to make it brighter, bolder and up to date. With this design refresh, I'm sure you can smell their delicious calzones through the screen - just don't lick it.
